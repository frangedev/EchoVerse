# EchoVerse 🎛🪐  
_Analog soul. Digital space._  

**EchoVerse** is a retro-futuristic delay & reverb plugin for Ableton Live, inspired by the legendary Roland Space Echo. Recreated as a Max for Live device, EchoVerse fuses the lo-fi charm of tape echo with modern stereo processing and time-warping capabilities.
